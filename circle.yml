      # We need to build the assets with webpack which varies for both dev and
      # production. We can either package these as separate docker files, or
      # have 1 docker file which builds the assets when it runs (and can check
      # an environmental variable to determine what should be built). The
      # latter means that we would have to build for every N containers we
      # deploy, vs always building twice (dev and production) as two separate
      # images and then being able to deploy those images to as many containers
      # we want without rebuilding the assets. We're going with building two
      # images, first dev and then production.
