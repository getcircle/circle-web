<h4>Terms and Conditions ("Terms")</h4>
<p>Last updated: March 25, 2015</p>

Please read these Terms and Conditions ("Terms", "Terms and Conditions") carefully before using the Circle mobile applications (the "Service") operated by RH Labs Inc.

<h4> Terms Used in This Document </h4>
<p>
The terms "Provider", "us", "we" or "our" refer to RH Labs, Inc. When we say “you,” we mean an individual user. Throughout most of this document, we refer to a "Customer." We use the term "Customer" because we want to be clear that this is a contract between RH Labs Inc. and a company (or other legal entity) that uses our Service for its personnel. The Service is not currently designed for individual users that work at companies that do not have an agreement with us. If you are an individual user, please see your company for terms and conditions that apply to you regarding the Service.
</p>

<h4> Acceptance of Our Agreement </h4>
<p>
Please read this document (the “Agreement”) carefully, as it governs Customer’s access to the Service and our practices regarding information. When you click “I AGREE”, install an App, or use the Service, you agree on behalf of Customer to be bound by this Agreement as of that date (the “Effective Date”).
</p>

<h4> Changes to the Agreement </h4>
<p>
We may need to change the terms of this Agreement in the future. Any change will take effect when we notify Customer of the change (either through an email notice or a message delivered through the Service) and Customer accepts the change (via email or an electronic click-to-accept method).
</p>

<h4> Representations About You </h4>
<p>
We want to make sure that the person clicking to agree to this Agreement is able to enter into a binding contract. Accordingly, you represent that you have the power and authority to enter into this Agreement on behalf of Customer. You also represent that (a) you have read and understand this Agreement, (b) you are 18 years of age or older, and (c) the information that you provide to us about Customer will be current, true, accurate, supportable and complete.
</p>

<h4> Users </h4>
<p>
There are two types of users of the Service: Administrative users (“Admins”), who have authority to manage and administer Customer’s account, and “Basic Users,” which includes all other employees and personnel. We refer to Admins and Basic Users collectively as “Users.” By using the Service, Users are required to abide by the terms of this Agreement. Any breach by a User will be a breach by Customer. Customer and Admins are responsible for managing and administering Basic User accounts. Customer and Admins are solely responsible for the security and confidentiality of Customer’s account information and will ensure that no third party uses Customer’s account. Customer and Admins must immediately notify us in the event that Customer or an Admin becomes aware of any unauthorized access to the Service or any violation of this Agreement. We reserve the right to terminate or suspend a User’s access to the Service for any reason.
</p>

<h4> Use of Trademarks, Logos and Materials </h4>
<p>
In order for us to activate and effectively operate our Service, Customer will provide us with all necessary information, materials and assistance, as reasonably requested by us. Customer grants to us a non-exclusive license to use Customer’s trademarks and other applicable proprietary rights as may be reasonably necessary or helpful in connection with the provision of the Service described below. During the Term, either party may include the name and logo of the other party in its lists of customers or vendors, in accordance with the other party's standard trademark usage guidelines (if any).
</p>

<h4> Restrictions on Using the Service </h4>
<p>
Customer and its Users may not use or exploit the Service in any unauthorized or unlawful way, including by: <br/>
(a) renting, leasing, lending, selling, redistributing, reproducing or sublicensing access to the Service, <br/>
(b) copying, decompiling, reverse-engineering, disassembling, attempting to derive the source code of, modifying, or creating derivative works of the Service, or any part of the Service, or <br/>
(c) allowing any other person to use Customer's User accounts or providing User passwords to any other person or entity. If the above restrictions are prohibited by applicable law or by one of our license(s), then the activities are permitted only to the extent necessary to comply with the law or licenses.
</p>

<h4> Our Reserved Rights </h4>
<p>
We reserve all rights in and to the Service and all related intellectual property not expressly granted under this Agreement. Customer acknowledges that (a) any and all suggestions for correction, change and modification to the Service and other feedback (including but not limited to quotations of written or oral feedback), information and reports provided to Provider by Customer (collectively “Feedback”); and (b) all improvements, updates, modifications or enhancements, whether made, created or developed by Provider or otherwise relating to Feedback (collectively, “Revisions”), are and will remain the property of Provider. All Feedback and Revisions become the sole and exclusive property of Provider and Provider may use and disclose Feedback and/or Revisions for any purpose without further notice or compensation to Customer and without retention by Customer of any proprietary or other right or claim. Customer hereby assigns to Provider any and all right, title and interest (including, but not limited to, any patent, copyright, future copyright, trade secret, trademark, show-how, know-how and any and all other intellectual property right) that Customer may have in and to any and all Feedback and Revisions. Customer hereby agrees to waive any moral rights you may have in any and all Feedback and Revisions, and consents to any act which amounts to an infringement of any such moral right, in favor of Provider. At Provider’s request, you will execute any document, registration or filing required to give effect to these provisions.
</p>

<h4> Compliance with Applicable Law </h4>
<p>
Customer and each User uses the Service at its own initiative and is responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including without limitation any federal, state or local employment, labor and/or tax laws. We may also impose limits on the use or access to the Service as required by law.
</p>

<h4> Maintenance and Availability </h4>
<p>
We want you to be successful with the Service and will provide Customer with a high level of support. The most effective method to contact us is through the help or feedback section within the Service. Scheduled system maintenance will take place from time to time, and during this time, the Service or elements of the Service may be unavailable. Emergency maintenance may be required at other times in the event of system failure. We make no representation that the Service is available or permitted in any particular location. Use of the Service is void where prohibited. Customer specifically acknowledges that outage and downtime may occur.
</p>

<h4> Content and Usage Data </h4>
<p>
(a) License in Content. Customer and Users are responsible for all text, images, videos, photos, sounds, links, works of authorship, materials, comments, and other User generated content (“Content”) submitted to the Service. We do not claim ownership of the Content; however, by posting or sharing Content, Customer grants to us and our third party partners (such as IT companies that help us develop and maintain the Service) a non-exclusive (meaning Customer and the Users are free to license the Content to anyone else), fully-paid, royalty-free (meaning we do not have to pay for our use of the Content), fully sublicensable (so that we can use our affiliates and subcontractors to provide the Service), transferable (meaning that we transfer the license to a third party), irrevocable (meaning that Customer may not revoke or rescind the license for any reason once the Content is uploaded), worldwide (because the Internet is and the Service may be global in reach) license under Customer’s intellectual property and proprietary rights to use and distribute the Content in order to provide the Service to Customer. Customer is responsible for backing up its Content and agrees that after termination of this Agreement, it may not have access to its Content.
<br/><br/>
(b) Prohibitions Regarding Content. Users may not submit any Content that is malicious, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive or threatening, or that promotes illegal or immoral activities. It is important to us that Users do not use the Service to infringe the rights of others. Customer represent to us that, to its knowledge (i) Users have the right to share Content via the Service, and (ii) the posting and sharing of Content does not violate the privacy rights, publicity rights, copyrights, trademark rights, contract rights or any other rights of any person or entity. We have the right to remove any of the Content from the Service in our sole discretion, including because it does or may infringe another party’s rights.
<br/><br/>
(c) Blind Data. Users may provide information and other data to us from data fields within the Service, or otherwise based on Users’ interaction with the Service. We may compile, synthesize and analyze this data and information in order to provide, monitor and improve the Service, such as to generate anonymized usage statistics (“Blind Data”). Any Blind Data will not personally identify Customer or any User or the source of the data. If we generate Blind Data, it will be owned by us and we may use it for any lawful business purpose, such as providing products and services.
</p>

<h4> Confidentiality </h4>
<p>
The Service (including the Apps and the software), this Agreement, any Blind Data we generate, and any other proprietary or confidential information provided to the Customer, constitutes our valuable proprietary information and trade secrets (“Confidential Information”). Customer’s Content constitutes Customer’s Confidential Information. Each party agrees not to disclose the other’s Confidential Information and to use the same degree of protection that it uses to protect similar proprietary and confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care. Each party will use the other’s Confidential Information only for its internal use, except where required by law or a valid court order or as provided in this Agreement. All Confidential Information will remain the sole property of the disclosing party unless otherwise provided in this Agreement. Each party will have the right to seek an injunction (without having to post a bond) to prevent any breach or continued breach of this section.
</p>

<h4> Third Party Elements </h4>
<p>
We may host the Service using our own infrastructure or contract a third party to host the Service on our behalf. Customer acknowledges that our Service may contain data, software or components that are either owned by a third party or in the public domain (“Third Party Elements”). Customer’s rights in the Third Party Elements are subject to the terms of the applicable third party license(s). RH Labs Inc. has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for the content, privacy policies, or practices of any third party web sites or services. We do not warrant the offerings of any of these entities/individuals or their websites.

You acknowledge and agree that RH Labs Inc. shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such content, goods or services available on or through any such third party web sites or services.

We strongly advise you to read the terms and conditions and privacy policies of any third party web sites or services that you visit.
</p>

<h4> Mobile Application Terms </h4>
<p>
If a User downloads an App for a smart phone, tablet or other mobile device, the User may be asked to agree to the terms of any End User License Agreement (“EULA”), if any, we may offer. If the App does not have a EULA, we hereby grant the User a non-exclusive, revocable, non-sublicenseable, non-transferable license to use the App in connection with the Service only and subject to the terms of this Agreement.
</p>

<h4> Term and Termination </h4>
<p>
This Agreement begins on the Effective Date and will continue on a month-to-month basis until terminated by either the Customer or us. Customer may cancel its subscription at any time by contacting us through the help or feedback section of the Service. Cancellation will be effective at the end of the current subscription month. Customer will not be entitled to receive any refunds or prorated fees for partial months due to a cancellation or termination of this Agreement. Customer’s and its Users’ right to use or access the Service will terminate automatically upon notice from us if Customer fails to comply with any terms of this Agreement. Upon termination of the Agreement, all rights granted to Customer and its Users under this Agreement will cease.
